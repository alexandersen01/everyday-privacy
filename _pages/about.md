The goal of this project is to educate people about online privacy and security, by securing their accounts and removing unnecessary data, and inform about which information is being collected.
A secondary goal would be to do this in such a manner that everyone is able to contribute to the project by updating when new information comes, add new services to reach more people.

The project started out as a solo standalone project at the [University of Bergen](https://uib.no).

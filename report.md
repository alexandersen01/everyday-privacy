# Introduction
<!-- TODO -->
The goal of this project is to educate people about online privacy and security, by securing their accounts and removing unnecessary data, and inform about which information is being collected. 
A secondary goal would be to do this in such a manner that everyone is able to contribute to the project by updating when new information comes, add new services to reach more people.

Today, there are existing solutions to this problem, like PrivacyTools[^20] and Prism Break[^21]. But these tools are proactive and you need to seek information actively. With this project, you should be able to specify what kind of services you use and get the correct information.

# Website
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Screenshot of frontpage -->
The website introduces the user with possibility to select which services they use, where the user is then taken to a separate page with a total overview of all the services the user selected. On this separate page, the user is then presented with steps to secure their account, steps to retake their privacy and an overview of what information each service collect. The services also displays who owns each service, which has been added to make the user aware who actually owns the data the user provides them.

If there has recently been a breach or leak, there will be a notification alert under the navigation header letting the user know which service has been affected and the date from when the news broke.

## Technologies & tools
<!-- TODO -->
The website is built with a static-site generator, Jekyll[^1], using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. There is no back-end, nothing is rendered from the server, everything the user sees is already generated and is only displayed by their browser. The data provided by the user is stored in `localStorage` in their browser and never sent to a server. Jekyll uses a template engine called Liquid[^3], which makes it possible to populate HTML and Markdown from data-files
instead of manually having to update values for each HTML or Markdown file.

SASS is a CSS post-processor[^2], that supports partials, nesting and much more. I chose to use this as it allows for more readability and sorting, since you are able to split up the CSS into different files, called partials, while it is only required to reference one main-stylesheet in HTML.

Jekyll has the ability to populate and generate HTML from data files; `JSON`, `YAML`, `CSV` or `TSV`, and Markdown. Built into Jekyll is something called *collections*, which allows for auto-generating of specific pages based front-matter[^21] and Markdown. I chose to use this approach for all the services, as this will allow for scalability in the future when adding more services.

You are also able to use the content from the collections on other pages as well, you can retrieve it using *Liquid*, liked mentioned earlier.

<!-- Add screenshot of mobile layout, maybe in a mockup -->
The website has been made to look good on both desktop and mobile, which has been made possible using media-queries[^5] in CSS. The website scales dynamically based on the viewport of the user, making it more accessible for everyone to use. The information provided is identical as the HTML-markup is unchanged and only some properties of the CSS is changed to accommodate the viewport of the user.


## Why I chose the technologies & tools
The reasons behind choosing these technologies and tools are simple: for a project of this scale and with a purpose like this, there is no reason to use any technology other than a static-site generator (you could also create everything manually with plain HTML). It could also be looked upon as contradicting to have a back-end handling all the data the user provides, as this would add the need to have a privacy policy stating how the information provided will and can be used.

As everything is stored in the browser, the user has the ability to remove their information whenever they want and are in control of their own data instead of a third-party. A added benefit of a static-site generator, is that the size of the website is quite small (=>100kB), which makes it very fast and it does not have to rely on having a fast hosting provider.


# Platforms/services 
<!-- TODO -->
I chose to use the most common and popular services, as these are well known and they can often be overlooked in terms of security and privacy, specifically Facebook products (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp), Snapchat, LinkedIn and Signal. Some of them are social networks and some focus primarily on messaging.

<!-- Explain what each service is -->
Facebook products is owned and developed by Facebook Inc., which is a technology company that offers services in their social network ecosystem, i.e. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. This report will go into detail for Facebook products, specifically Facebook, Instagram and Messenger as all of these share the same policy. 
WhatsApp will be viewed separately since they have their own policy, even though they are all under the same umbrella.
Snapchat is a social messaging application owned and developed by Snap Inc., which is a camera company. 
LinkedIn is a professional networking social network owned and developed by Microsoft Corporation.
Signal is an encrypted messaging service developed and owned by the non-profit organization Signal Foundation.


## Privacy policies
<!-- TODO -->
The purpose of a privacy policy is to disclose all of the different ways a company uses, discloses and manages a customer or client's data[^6]. Here, I will go into what each of the policies say they collect and why they collect what they collect. 


### Snapchat 
Snapchat presents their policy in two ways, one that is easy to read, like a summary, and one more technical and detailed. Both of them cover the same material, but the technical version lets you know what they collect, why they collect it and who they share that information with. I will cover the more technical one, as it contains more information. The policy[^7] is divided into different sections, see \ref{appendix:snapchat_toc}.


#### Why they collect the data

Snapchat collect a lot of different details about you. According to their policy, these details are collected in order to provide you with a better service and to serve you targeted advertisements. They share their details with other users; business partners, third parties and the general public. Who they end up sharing the information with, depends on how you use the service. The Snapchat app is "constantly collecting and
updating information about the things you might like and dislike[^7]", so that they can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements. They mention that they are not responsible for how third parties collect and/or use your information. They delete the content whenever it is necessary. This depends on how you use the app, if you are under investigation or if you have saved messages and/or photos in the app.


#### Who is in control of the data

They give you a quick rundown that you are the one in control over your information and you can request to download your own data, but the request can be denied if the request "risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful[^7]". You can limit the permission their app has, but this will also limit the app experience. You can modify your advertising preferences, but as mention earlier, they are "constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike[^7]". 
This means that when you have updated your advertising preferences, it may update itself later based on your behaviour when interacting with the service. Hence, there is little you can do to prevent targeted advertisements.
However, you can limit who can contact you or view your "Stories". If you want to remove any other information, you have to request to delete your account.

It is explicitly mentioned that "Snap Inc. is the controller of your personal information". Depending on where you live you have varying rights of your own personal information. They justify this since their service is free, they can use some of your information to "try and show you ads you'll find interesting[^7]", and mention that this does not outweigh your right to privacy, they only use data that does not "significantly impact your privacy".


### Facebook products
<!-- TODO -->
Facebook presents their policy with a Data policy where they disclose what information they collect. It is presented in a technical way with long paragraphs and detail heavy sentences. The policy[^8] is divided into multiple sections with more sub-sections, see \ref{appendix:fb_toc}.


#### Why they collect the data

As you may be able to tell, both from the project-website and the overview above, it is a lot of data. Facebook collects these details in order to provide you with a better service and to serve you targeted advertisement. Facebook connects your information across Facebook Products and devices and they use the information they have ("including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see[^8]"). 
They also use the information they have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences. This is done in order to maintain their integrity, promote safety and security on and off their products. Information provided is use for research and innovation, for a social good, i.e. general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.

#### How they share data

The section about "How is this information shared?" indicates that you are in control of who you share your information with, if you want to disclose it to the following; `Public`, `Friends of friends`, `Friends only` and `Only me`. This is also true for what others might share about you, that is already available on Facebook Products.
If you choose to use/enable third-party integrations, such as apps and websites, they receive information about what you post and share.
If Facebook were to be acquired, they may transfer all your information to the new owner.
Facebook works with third-party partners which help Facebook provide and improve their products, and Facebook helps the partners grow their business which "makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world[^8]". In the same paragraph, they say "We don't sell any of information to anyone, and we never will[^8]". A contradicting statement when they explain in the subsection below that they provide their partners and advertisers with statistics and reports about user engagement. They do not share personally identifiable information unless you have given them permission.


The Facebook companies/products share the same infrastructure, systems and technology. This means that they all share data between them, so that they can "provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience..." across all the products.

Reasoning behind all the collection and sharing mentioned earlier, is because; they need to fulfill their terms of service, comply with their legal obligations, protect your vital interest, or those of others, as necessary in the public interest and "as necessary for our legitimate interest, including our interest in providing an innovative, personalized, safe, and profitable service to our users and partners...[^8]".


#### Who is in control of the data

Facebook stores data "until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first". <!-- Contradicting statement -->
You are able to delete data at any time, for example if you were to search for something, you are able to delete that query at any time, but the log will be deleted automatically after 6 months. 
If you decide to delete your account, Facebook deletes "things" you have posted, such as photos and status updates. But information others have shared about you will not be deleted, like photos, address books with your details etc.

You are able to exercise your rights provided under the GDPR, which includes; the right to access, rectify, port and erase your data. They provide simple instruction to simple view the settings for the different products, and also a link to a form where you can object to how they are managing your data.


### WhatsApp

WhatsApp presents their privacy policy[^14] in a straight forward way where everything is laid out with a natural language, but some parts may seem a bit technical when they mention how they share information with other Facebook products. Their policy is divided into multiple sections, see \ref{appendix:whatsapp_toc}.


#### Why they collect the data

As with both Snapchat and the other Facebook products mentioned earlier, they collect a bunch of different data from their users, as you are also able to see on the project website. But what is making WhatsApp stand out, is that the content in the messages, the primary way of using the application, is encrypted and the content is not readable by Facebook. 
WhatsApp collects data in order to "operate, improve, understand, customize, support and market..." their service. The types of data they collect may depend on the way you use their services, but if you choose not to provide the information required, you will be unable to access their services. They also collect data in order to connect your data with Facebook products that you may or may not use. 
As with other Facebook products, they also collect data in order to combat harmful conduct and protect users.


#### How they share data

They share data based on metadata from your messages, location, summaries keywords from the message, who you are communicating with, timestamps and other telemetry data like device information, battery level etc. They also share your interactions you have made with WhatsApp Businesses. It is not explicitly mentioned what kind of data businesses can and cannot share, but it is mentioned that it is supposed to be in accordance with applicable laws.

As with the other Facebook products, WhatsApp is no different when it comes to sharing among themselves, WhatsApp shares all the data they collect across all Facebook products. There is a whole separate section dedicated to how and why they share data amongst the Facebook products.

It is not explicitly mentioned how they share information with third-parties, but they mentioned multiple times that this is something that they do, and that they require them to do so in accordance with their instructions and terms.


#### Who is in control of the data

The word "*control*" is only mentioned twice in the whole privacy policy, the first being that you are in control of who you communicate with and the second being in the event of a merger or acquisition etc. of WhatsApp, the new successors/owners are entitled to your data. I assume this means that WhatsApp (or Facebook Inc.) is the one in control of your data as long as you decide to have an account.

When you delete your account, all account info, undelivered messages and message history is deleted from their servers.



### LinkedIn

LinkedIn introduces us to the policy in a different way than the others, they start of by showing an embedded YouTube video where they explain the privacy policy[^15] in a rather simple manner. The rest of the policy is presented in multiple section with detailed explanations for each section, see \ref{appendix:linkedin_toc}.


#### Why they collect data

As this is not mentioned or presented directly in the policy, it is insinuated multiple times that they collect data in order to provide you with a service where you can connect with colleagues, friends and other professionals in your field of work. Data is also collected in order to prevent security breaches, based on how they monitor the data and to give you relevant advertisements to grow their service.


#### How they share data

Most of your interactions on the service is shared among other members of the service, like posts, likes, follows, comments and messages. If your employer uses LinkedIn's enterprise service, your employer may be able to gather and share your data with your permission, which they can later monetize.

Other members and/or their employers can, for legal or professional reasons, archive their communications with you.

Other services that you have connected to your account may look up your profile and collect your personal and public data, but this is possible to opt out of. But as you connect your account to other services, their own privacy policy apply in terms of how your data may be used.

Your personal data will be shared with LinkedIn's affiliates, they combine data internally across different services in order to be more relevant and useful to you and others.


#### Who is in control of the data

According to their policy, this will be dependent on where you are, if you are outside the "*Designated Countries*", LinkedIn Corporation will be the controller of your personal data. *Designated Countries* include the EU, EEA and Switzerland. If you live within the *Designated Countries*, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company will be the controller of your personal data.

Most of your personal data is kept as long as your account is active in order to provide you with the service. You have the right to access and control you personal data, the right to delete, change/correct, object to and right to access your data.
<!-- I like that they are very clear about this -->



### Signal

Signal's privacy policy[^16] is something different than the others, as it is the shortest and gets straight to the point. The policy, as with the others, are divided into sections, see \ref{appendix:signal_toc}


#### Why they collect data

In order to use Signal, as with WhatsApp, you need to provide your phone number to create an account, the service will not work without it. They may collect you address book, with your permission, in order to tell you which one of your contacts are on Signal. However, this information is encrypted and is not accessible by Signal themselves.


#### How they share data

The policy states that they "may" share information with third parties, like the ones who send verification codes when setting up your account, and third parties like YouTube, Spotify and Giphy if you share anything from these services within the application. Signal may also share data in order to accommodate legalities.


#### Who is in control of the data

You are the sole controller of your data, all your data is encrypted on Signal's servers, and this only includes your phone number, optionally a profile picture and status message which is not accessible by Signal.



## Security and privacy settings

As for this project, I have only been able to test and verify security and privacy settings on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Snapchat and Signal, as I use some of these personally and some of them do not require real personal information in order to create an account.

For Facebook (including Messenger), Instagram and Snapchat, the steps needed in order to increase your accounts security and maintain your privacy are similar, but there are some differences.

In order to change any setting on Snapchat, it is required that you use the mobile application, you are not able to do so in a browser. For Facebook's products, Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, you are able to do almost everything from the browser, but some settings are limited to the mobile applications. 
One example for this would be deleting all Location History data from Facebook. You are unable to delete this while accessing Facebook from the browser, even their Help-page explicitly say the option is only available on iOS and Android[^9].

### Security

A notable difference for which security options you have on Facebook and Instagram that is not offered from Snapchat, is to verify where you are logged in. This could be beneficial if you were to borrow someone's phone to check your Snapchat account and forgot to log out.

Signal has a rather big security advantage. Since you are not able to send unencrypted (plain text) messages, it makes it impossible for users to mistakenly send unencrypted message. As with Messenger, you have to actively enter "*Secret Message mode*" to send encrypted messages.

A rather surprising security option on Facebook, is that you are able to provide a Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key, to encrypt your email communications with Facebook[^17], which is not very common among social networks and no other service that I have reviewed offers this option.
<!-- TODO add more -->


### Privacy

On both Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat you are able to configure your advertisement settings. 
On Snapchat the settings are presented as how their partners can use information about you, both on and off Snapchat, they also have a separate setting where you are able to toggle different interests, so that Snapchat can serve you more personalised content and advertisements.
On Facebook's products , the settings are presented with _"common questions"_ as the introduction, which resolves about **"Does Facebook sell my data?"**, other than that you are able to manage how your data is being used for advertisements.
For Instagram, the settings are nearly identical to the ones on Facebook, but you are not given the option to limit advertisements off Instagram based on your data, which you are able to do on Facebook.

For all services, you are able to request your data to be downloaded in a human-readable format, like HTML.

#### Deleting your account

In order to delete your accounts, the steps for each service varies. For Snapchat and Instagram you cannot delete you account from the apps, but for Snapchat you can find the instructions via the app, which will take you to the correct web-page. But on Instagram's app there is no mention of the step, you either have to look it up online or login via their website. For Facebook, you are able to delete your account via the browser or mobile app. Unexpectedly, both Facebook's and Instagram's guides suggest you download your data before deleting your
account, which Snapchat does not mention at all.
Also, it is not possible to delete your Messenger account without deleting your Facebook account. However, it is possible to deactivate your Facebook profile and still use Messenger, but it is not possible to have a Messenger account without an associated Facebook account.

As for Signal, it is only possible to delete your account via the app.


#### Location history

On Facebook (including Messenger), you are able to delete your location history, but only via the app, as mentioned earlier. But the story is not the same for Instagram. Even though it is developed by the same company, you are unable to delete your location history. However, you are able to edit and/or remove location data from individual posts.

As for Snapchat and Signal, Snapchat does not offer any options to delete your location history and for Signal it is not needed because the service does not collect any location data.


# Breach/leaked data

Breach data, can both be an intentional or unintentional release of secure or private information to an untrusted environment[^10].
In the context of this report, I will focus on the potential dangers of having personal data exposed online, and with personal data which includes; name, date of birth, address, phone number(s), friends and family, political views, religion etc.

Both Facebook products and Snapchat have both been victims to having data about their users released online, unintentionally. Facebook has had much more of a spotlight in this regard, because of their extremely large user base, with 2.8 billion monthly active users[^11]. Also because of how mainstream media picked up the story about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, where 50 million peoples data was harvested[^12].
For Snapchat, they have not had a lot of data breaches except for December 2013 when 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers were made publicly available on snapchatdb.info[^13].


## Potential attacks
<!-- TODO -->

There are potential attacks that are possible with just a few bits of data associated to a name. Here I will go through some of the more common attacks that are possible and that you should be aware of and how you could prevent it.

### SMS Two-Factor Authentication

By using SMS as a two-factor authentication method, you may be more vulnerable to social engineering and identity theft attacks. If your phone number and password were leaked alongside your username for a given service, they could potentially contact you via phone, email or social media impersonating the given service to try to get your two-factor authentication code. But, a scary scenario would be that they try to impersonate you while contacting your phone number's carrier in order
to get a new SIM-card they can control in your name. Then they can get the same two-factor code as you and login.

### Phishing attacks

Your email provider is most likely able to detect some of the more common phishing attack methods, but your phone number is not. Like the previous example, if your phone number were leaked alongside your username for a given service, they could try to get you to provide them with credentials for the given and/or other services while they impersonate someone they are not.

An example for this could be an older person, where their phone number were leaked along with their age, confirming for the attacker that this is an older person, which may not be tech savvy. Then the attacker could send this person an survey where they ask them which services they use, and if the victim answers this survey of the more common phishing attacks methods, but your phone number is not. Like the previous example, if your phone number were leaked alongside your username for a
given service, they could try to get you to provide them with credentials for the given and/or other services while they impersonate someone they are not.


# Discussion
<!-- Brief overview of what I'm going to discuss -->

In the discussions I will walk through how the different privacy policies differs and how the different services presents their settings for both security and privacy.


## Privacy policies

As you may be able to tell by having read this report, the different services have a lot in common when it comes to what they collect and the reason behind it. The common denominator here is "to provide you with the service", and in most cases the data is being shared, or more correctly sold to third parties. This is not the case for all services, like Signal, as their only revenue stream is from donations, but for Facebook products; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp their
revenue comes from selling the data provided by their users, even though they explicitly say that they "*Do not sell your data*". It is very contradicting to say that you do not sell your users data when you also mention on multiple occasions in your policy that you must share your users data in order to provide them with a service. 
It is fair to assume that they do not share this data for free, because how can they run their service? They need to share this data for a fee in order to exist. A good example on exactly this is a very recent article published by the Signal Foundation about the data Facebook provides advertisers with[^18].
The same is also true for the other services like Snapchat and LinkedIn, but the type of data provided may not be as accurate as Facebook's since they have a much larger user base to base their data on.

In WhatsApp policy, it is mentioned multiple times that the messages users exchange is encrypted and deleted from WhatsApp's (Facebook) servers after it has been delivered, but only the encrypted part is deleted, all the metadata sent along the message is not being mentioned as being deleted upon delivery to the recipient. This means personal data like location information, even without GPS permissions, recipients, timestamps and device information is being collected. 
There is no need to collect this information in order to provide the service, but it is necessary to have recipients and timestamps in order to deliver the message, but there is no need to collect and save the data.

A common similarity on multiple of these policies, is that they mention first that you, the user, is the main controller of the data you have provided, but when it comes to the section that mentions goes into detail it is revealed that it actually the service itself that owns and controls the data. 
You are just able to add, edit and delete it, but it is not guaranteed that the data is deleted after it has been edited nor deleted because it could be of the services interest to keep this information for security, privacy and commercially purposes. 
I would also like to point out that LinkedIn's policy stands out in this regard, because they are very clear from the beginning that they are the ones who are in the actual control of your data, and they even state it on multiple occasions.

Another thing that is mentioned in multiple policies, is address books. How come someone I know has the right to upload and share my information with a service that I might not want to use or support? The service should simply just delete this information if there is no match. Someone could have added a bunch of personal data to their address book, like real addresses, multiple emails, family relations etc. No one other than yourself should have the right to be allowed to store this sensitive information with one service.
This goes a bit back to when Facebook's policies say they use information they get from their partners to give you personalized advertisements, even though you do not have a Facebook account. It is also mentioned, in clear plain text that they collect data about you "whether or not you have a Facebook account", even though Facebook has denied that they do this when asked about *Shadow profiles*[^19].

Although none of the services; Facebook products (including WhatsApp), Snapchat and LinkedIn, mention that they sell data, it is heavily implied that they do, and they defend it by painting a picture that there is no other way that they can provide their service to their users.

## Security and privacy settings

The type of settings you are able to change for each service varies, as you may have been able to see on the project's website, but there are a few strange anomalies. There should not be a difference in how you adjust settings via an app and browser when the service is provided through both. 
Like I mentioned earlier with Facebook's location history, why should I only be able to delete it via the app? There might be a valid reason for you to not have their app installed on your phone, therefore you should have the ability to do the same in the browser as you can via the app and vice versa.

For Messenger, I find it strange that you are unable to adjust any settings at all without having to go directly to your Facebook account. Messenger should have the same options as Facebook, since they both share exactly the same data between each other.

A very welcoming feature by Facebook is the ability to do a "*Privacy Checkup*", which works as an interactable way to adjust some of your privacy settings. Some of these settings have nice illustrations to demonstrate what each setting may enable or disable. This may make it more convenient to check your privacy settings regularly, as it might not be as intimidating as looking through all the different settings for your account.


# Conclusion

Starting of with this project, I was prepared to learn a lot and see a lot of surprises, but after reading every services privacy policies and going through some of the services security and privacy settings, I am still in awe of what I have learned.

For the privacy policies, I can conclude that they are able to provide users with information explaining what they collect, how they collect and why they collect data. But, there is a lot of variance in how they present it. 
I believe Snapchat is a great example of how it could be, they have a non-technical version of their privacy policy which they state is for those that are only able to spare a few minutes. This explains and give some justification to how their application operates and handles data.
With all the other policies, except Signal's, you need some technical understanding and up to 20 minutes of spare time to read, and then again you would need time to process all this information.

As with the security and privacy settings, there is a lot you can do. You can increase the security of each service substantially and you are able to limit how your data is being used, mostly by limiting how they can give you relevant advertisements.

I believe the project's website has been able to achieve its goal, if someone wants to learn how to increase the security of their account or limit data hoarding, they can do so via the website. While they are there, they are able to see what kind of data they actually collect, based on the service's policy. If someone wants to learn more about a specific service, they can see the recent headlines the service has been in and their recent data breaches (if there are any).


# Future work

Like mentioned in the introduction as a secondary goal, everyone should be able to contribute to this project and improve upon it. Therefore this project will be published online as an open source project under the GPLv3 license, requiring all kinds of forks of the project to remain open source and publicly available.

For the future of the project, I would like to add even more services, not just social media, but nation specific services, like Finn.no etc.

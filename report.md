# Introduction
<!-- TODO -->
The goal of this project is to educate everyday folks about online privacy and security, by securing their accounts and removing unnecessary data, and show what information is being collected.

# Website
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Screenshot of frontpage -->
The website starts off by giving the user the ability to select which services they use, where the user are then taken to a seperate page with a total overview of all the services the user selected. On this seperate page, the user are then presented with steps to secure their account, steps to retake their privacy and what information each service collect. The services also display who owns each service, which has been added to make the user aware who actually owns the data the user provides them.

If there has recently been a breach or leak, there will be a notification alert under the navigation header letting the user know which service is affected and the date of when the news broke.

## Technologies & tools
<!-- TODO -->
The website is built with a static-site generator, Jekyll[^1], using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. There is no back-end, nothing is rendered from the server, everything the user sees is already generated and is only displayed by their browser. The data provided by the user is stored in `localStorage` in their browser and never sent to a server. Jekyll uses a template engine called Liquid[^3], which makes it possible to populate HTML and Markdown from data-files
instead of manually having to update vaules for each HTML or Markdown file.

SASS[^2] is a CSS post-processor, that supports partials, nesting and much more. I chose to use this as it allows for more readability and sorting, since you can now split up the CSS into different files, called partials, while it is only required to reference one main-stylesheet in HTML.

Jekyll has the ability to populate HTML and Markdown with data-files, stored as `JSON`, `YAML`, `CSV` or `TSV`. I chose to use `YAML` for the added benefit that it can often be easier to read and understand, as the syntax is based on colons, hyphens and identations. All the different information about each service is stored in `_data/service/`, where each service has their own `YAML` file, this file is then being used to auto-generate a HTML-page from a layout-template. This
auto-generation is not built into Jekyll by default, and is provided by a plugin, `jekyll-datapage_gen`[^4].

There are three pages that are using data-files; the front page, the "My services" page and the overview of all services that the website has data on.

<!-- Add screenshot of mobile layout, maybe in a mockup -->
The website has been made to look good on both desktop and mobile, which is made possible with media-queries[^5] in CSS. The website scales dynamically based on the viewport of the user, making it more accessible for everyone to use. The infomration provided is identical, as the HTML-markup is not changed, only some properties of the CSS is changed to accomodate the viewport of the user.


## Why I chose the technologies & tools
The reason behind chosing these technologies and tools are simple: for a project of this scale and with a purpose like this, there is no reason to use any technology other than a static-site generator (you could also create everything manually with plain HTML). It could also be looked upon as contraditing to have a backend handling all the data the user provides, as this would add the need to have a privacy policy stating how the information provided will/can be used.

As everything is stored in the browser, the user has the ability to remove their information whenever they want and they are the ones that are in control of their own data instead of a third-party. A added benefit of a static-site generator, is that the size of the website quite small (=>100kB), which makes it very fast and does not have to rely on having a fast hosting provider.


# Platforms/services 
<!-- TODO -->
I chose to use the most common and popular services, as these are well known and they can often be overlooked in terms of security and privacy, specifcally Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, or even more specifically Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. They are all social networks, and function in different ways.

<!-- Explain what each service is -->
Snap Inc. is camera company, they provide fast and fun ways to express yourself, live in the momemnt, learn about the world and have fun together. Facebook Inc. is a technology company that offers services in their social network ecosystem, i.e. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Disclaimer: The project-website has more than these services, they are more a proof of concept in order to show what the website would look like with information from all of the services.

## Privacy policies
<!-- TODO -->
The purpose of a privacy policy is to disclose all of the different ways a company uses, discloses and manages a customer or client's data[^6]. Here I will go into what each of the policies say they collect and why they collect what they collect. 
To make it clear from the get-go, Facebook's and Instagram's policies are identical, the only notable mention is that they have swapped out the name of the different products whenever neccessary, therefore when I mention Facebook, Instagram will follow the same suit.

### Snapchat (Snap Inc.)
Snapchat presents their policy in two ways, one that is easy to read, like a summary, and one more technical and detailed. Both of them cover the same material, but the technical version lets you know what they collect, why they collect it and who they share that information with. I will cover the more technical one, as it contains more information.

The policy is divided into different sections;
- "Information We Collect", 
- "How We Use Information", 
- "How We Share Information", 
- "Third-Party Content and Integrations", 
- "How Long We Keep Your Information", 
- "Control Over Your Information"
- And users in different parts of the world, EU, Brazil, Mexico and California

As you can tell from the project-website, they collect a lot of different details about you. According to their policy, these details are collected in order provide you with a better service and to serve you targeted advertisments. They share their details with other users; business partners, third parties and the general public. Who they end up sharing the information with, depends on how you use the service. The Snapchat app is "constantly collecting and
updating information about the things you might like and dislike", so that they can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements. They mention that they are not responsible for how third parties collect and/or use your information. They delete the content whenever it is neccessary, it depends on how you use the app, if you are under investigation or if you have save messages and/or photos in the app.

They give you a quick rundown that you are the one in control over your information, you can request to download your own data, but the request can be denied if the request "risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful". You can limit the permission their app has, but this will also limit the app experience. You can modify your advertising preferences, but as mention earlier, they are "constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike", so
updating your advertising preference will update itself later according to how you interact with the service. You can limit who can contact you, view your "Stories" etc. If you want to remove any other information, you have to request to delete your account.

It is explicitly mentioned that "Snap Inc. is the controller of your personal information". Depending on where you live you have varying rights of your own personal information. They justify since their service is free, they can use some of your information to "try and show you ads you'll find interesting", and mention that this does not outweigh your right to privacy, they only use data that does not "significantly impact your privacy".

### Facebook and Instagram (Facebook Inc.)
<!-- TODO -->
Facebook presents their policy with a Data policy, where they disclose what information they collect. It is presented in a technical way, long paragraphs and detail heavy senteneces.

The policy is divided into different sections with more sub-sections;

# Everyday Privacy

The goal of this project is to educate people about online privacy and security, by securing their accounts and removing unnecessary data, and inform about which information is being collected. 
A secondary goal would be to do this in such a manner that everyone is able to contribute to the project by updating when new information comes, add new services to reach more people.

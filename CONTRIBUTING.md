## Ground Rules
Be respectful, considerate of other!


### Responsibilities
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any classes, pages or styling to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Everyday Privacy? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
- Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.


## Getting started
### General guidelines

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
4. Submit a Pull Request and specify what you have changed, fixed or added.

### Small or "obvious" fixes
Small contributions are considired as the following;
- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo corrections, white space and formatting changes
- Changes to `Gemfile` `_config.yml`
- Moving source files from one directory to another


### Adding a service

1. Use `_services/facebook.md` as a template
2. Include an SVG version of the service's logo
